# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This iteration focuses on enhancing the existing HedgeX high-frequency trading application to provide a complete, production-ready desktop trading platform for NIFTY 50 stocks. The system will integrate with Zerodha Kite API while maintaining strict local data processing and privacy standards. The iteration builds upon the basic project structure to deliver a fully functional HFT engine with user authentication, persistent settings, and real-time trading capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Authentication System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want secure local authentication with encrypted credential storage, so that my API keys and trading data remain protected on my local machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first launches the application THEN the system SHALL display a login/setup screen
2. WHEN a user enters their Zerodha API credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them locally using argon2 hashing
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a session token that persists until app closure
4. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and prevent access
5. WHEN the application is closed THEN the system SHALL securely clear the session while preserving encrypted credentials

### Requirement 2: Real-time Market Data Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want live market data for NIFTY 50 stocks through WebSocket connections, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on real-time price movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connection to Zerodha Kite API
2. WHEN market data is received THEN the system SHALL process and display real-time prices for all NIFTY 50 stocks
3. IF WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN market hours end THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle connection closure
5. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms latency for price updates

### Requirement 3: High-Frequency Trading Engine

**User Story:** As an algorithmic trader, I want a fast order execution engine with configurable strategies, so that I can capitalize on market opportunities with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trading conditions are met THEN the system SHALL place orders within 50ms of signal generation
2. WHEN an order is placed THEN the system SHALL track order status and handle confirmations/rejections
3. IF order placement fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt retry based on configured parameters
4. WHEN strategy parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes without restarting the engine
5. WHEN risk limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL halt trading and alert the user

### Requirement 4: Persistent Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to configure and persist my trading strategies, stock selections, and system preferences, so that my setup is maintained between application sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL save changes to encrypted SQLite database
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved configurations
3. WHEN API keys are updated THEN the system SHALL re-encrypt and store the new credentials securely
4. IF database corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL create a backup and restore from last known good state
5. WHEN strategy parameters are changed THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before saving

### Requirement 5: Trading Dashboard and Controls

**User Story:** As a trader, I want an intuitive dashboard to monitor positions, P&L, and control trading operations, so that I can effectively manage my trading activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current positions, P&L, and account balance
2. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL update position information in real-time
3. WHEN emergency stop is triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately halt all trading operations
4. IF connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL display connection status and provide manual reconnection options
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display trade logs from local database

### Requirement 6: Local Data Storage and Privacy

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious trader, I want all my trading data and credentials stored locally with encryption, so that my sensitive information never leaves my machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt all sensitive information using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN the application processes data THEN the system SHALL ensure no data is transmitted to external servers except Zerodha API
3. IF data export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide encrypted backup files
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL store them locally with automatic rotation
5. WHEN the application is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL provide option to securely delete all stored data

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
3. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert the user and attempt graceful recovery
4. WHEN logs reach size limits THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate and archive old logs
5. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and alert the user

### Requirement 8: NIFTY 50 Stock Management

**User Story:** As a trader focused on NIFTY 50, I want to easily select and manage which stocks to trade, so that I can customize my trading universe based on my strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display current NIFTY 50 stock list
2. WHEN stocks are selected for trading THEN the system SHALL save preferences and apply to trading engine
3. IF NIFTY 50 composition changes THEN the system SHALL update the available stock list
4. WHEN stock-specific parameters are set THEN the system SHALL apply individual settings per stock
5. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL allow selection/deselection of multiple stocks
